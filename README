= DESCRIPTION =
===============
GGG is a program that was designed for stochastic sampling
of genetic interactions in the early Drosophila embryo.
However, it also can be used for stochastic sampling
of reaction-diffusion processes in a discrete cylindrical
geometry in general.

GGG combines the Gillespie next-event sampling algorithm
for chemical reactions with the Meso-RD method to implement
a cylindrical array of reaction volumes that are coupled
by diffusive interchange between them.

The program takes a set of reaction-diffusion parameters
and an initial configuration as an input. It then calculates
reaction propensities from the reaction parameters and species
concentrations to generate a next-event queue for the whole
spatially resolved system. Diffusion events are treated as
birth-and-death events with a rate calculated from the diffusion
constant. The configurations are then updated successively
and propensity functions are adjusted accordingly.

A set of observed concentrations can be defined. These
observables can also be sums of concentrations. For the
defined set of observables the moments of the random variables
are acummulated with a defined measurement-interval. At the
end of the simulation the means and variances are calculated
and written as output.

The main purpose of our simulations was the detection of
gene expression boundary fluctuations. The code therefore is
capable to detect such boundaries and monitor the boundary
crossings as a random variable. A corresponding histogram
is generated as an estimate of the boundary position
distribution and written as an output at the end of the
simulation.
