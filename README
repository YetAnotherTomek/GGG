=======================

GGG is a program that allows for stochastic sampling
of genetic interactions in the developing Drosophila
embryo. It also can be used for stochastic sampling
of reaction-diffusion processes in a discrete cylindrical
geometry in general.

GGG combines the Gillespie next-event sampling algorithm
for chemical reactions with the Meso-RD method to implement
a cylindrical array of reaction volumes that are coupled
by diffusive interchange between them.
